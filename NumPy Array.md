## **NumPy Array**

- Fixed size containers of items that are more efficient than **Python lists** or **tuples** for data processing.
- They only store single data type (mixed data type are stored as string)
- They can be 1D or Multi dimensional.
- Array elememts can be modified, but the array size cannot change.
