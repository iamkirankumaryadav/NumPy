# NumPy

### **Why** to use NumPy ?
- Arithmetic operations
- Statistcs operations
- Linear algebra
- Bitwise operations
- Stacking, Searching, Sorting, Counting, Broadcasting and Matrix operations.
- Base for many other packages ( Pandas, SciPy, Statsmodel, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn )
- Essential library for scientific and mathematical projects.

### Python Lists vs NumPy Arrays

**Python List** | **NumPy Array**
:--- | :---
No support for vectorized operations | Supports vectorized operations (additions, multiplications)
**Heterogeneous** / mixed data type | **Homogeneous** data type
For loops are not efficient | For loops are fast and efficient
